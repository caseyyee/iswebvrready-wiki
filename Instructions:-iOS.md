_Currently natively unsupported in all browsers on iOS (and impossible to implement outside of Safari for iOS)._

[Firefox for iOS](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/ios/), [Google Chrome for iOS](https://developer.chrome.com/multidevice/ios/overview), and [Apple's Safari for iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser)) are all built atop the [WebKit browser](https://webkit.org/). As Apple permits only Safari to access privileged iOS utilities (e.g., the iOS Nitro engine), Firefox/Chrome/etc. for iOS use Apple's [`UIWebView`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiwebview) for loading and rendering content.

Because WebVR support is not available in WebKit, native WebVR support is currently unavailable in every browser on the iOS platform. A limited subset of the capabilities of the WebVR API, however, can be emulated for iOS browsers using [this WebVR Polyfill](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill) (which makes use of the phone's sensors to simulate a [Cardboard](https://vr.google.com/cardboard/)-like headset).
