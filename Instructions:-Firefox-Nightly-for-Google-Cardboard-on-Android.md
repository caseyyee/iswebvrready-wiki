* _Currently natively unsupported in [Firefox for Android](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/android/)._ For the time being, native WebVR support is deprecated to prioritize development of WebVR on Firefox on desktop.
* To emulate support, you may use the [WebVR Polyfill](https://github.com/borismus/webvr-polyfill) to emulate support.
* Native WebVR support is available in [Chromium for Android](https://webvr.info/get-chrome/).
