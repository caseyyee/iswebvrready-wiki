# Prerequisites

## VR hardware requirements

* [**HTC Vive** (consumer version 1.0) headset](https://www.vive.com/us/)
  * [Vive User Guide](http://dl4.htc.com/web_materials/Manual/Vive/Vive_User_Guide.pdf)
  * [SteamVR Support pages](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5254-FJKZ-7829)

If you have a [Vive Pre development kit](https://developer.viveport.com/managed-assets/shared/desktop/vive/Vive_PRE_User_Guide.pdf), you may still be able to follow these same instructions to use WebVR, but there are no guarantees of stability nor performance. (It's worth noting that there are mostly only the modifications made between the Vive Pre and Vive consumer version are mostly slight changes to the aesthetics and comfort [e.g., the most obvious being the IPD adjustment knob and slight headstrap adjustments].)

Support for the [Vive wireless motion controllers](https://www.vive.com/us/support/faqs/#Controllers) is [currently unavailable](https://iswebvrready.org/#gamepad-extensions) in the latest Firefox Nightly builds. You can follow the platform progress of the Firefox implementation of the [Gamepad API (Extensions)](https://w3c.github.io/gamepad/extensions.html) [here on IsWebVRReady.org](https://iswebvrready.org/#gamepad-extensions) (and, in particular, [this Firefox platform tracking bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1299926) for Vive controller support). Stay tuned!

## Platform requirements

* **Graphics card:** [NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-970) / [AMD Radeon R9 290](https://www.amd.com/en-us/products/graphics/desktop/r9), or better.
* **CPU:** [Intel i5-4590](http://ark.intel.com/products/80815/Intel-Core-i5-4590-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_70-GHz) / [AMD FX 8350](https://www.amd.com/en-us/products/processors/desktop/fx), or better.
* **Memory:** 4GB+ RAM.
* **Video output:** HDMI 1.4, [DisplayPort 1.2](http://www.displayport.org/faq/), or better.
* **USB ports:** one USB 2.0 (or faster) port.
* **OS:** [Windows 7 SP1](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15090/windows-7-install-service-pack-1-sp1) (64-bit) or newer.

You may download and run the [SteamVR Performance Test](http://store.steampowered.com/app/323910/) to ensure your machine meets the minimum requirements to enjoy VR in the HTC Vive.

You may wish to upgrade your Windows PC manually, order/build a new custom machine, or purchase a [prebuilt Vive-ready PC](https://www.vive.com/ready/).

## Software requirements

* You must be running [Windows 7 SP1](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15090/windows-7-install-service-pack-1-sp1) (64-bit) or newer. (Also, ensure you have installed the [Microsoft .NET Framework v4.6 or newer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48137)).
* Download, install, launch, and configure the [Vive with SteamVR](http://www.vive.com/us/setup/). (The Vive makes use of [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com)'s [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) application for browsing, purchasing, downloading, and installing VR experiences. SteamVR is installed as a separate application and contains the required runtime to render experiences to the Oculus Rift.)

(If needed, refer to the [Vive User Guide](http://dl4.htc.com/web_materials/Manual/Vive/Vive_User_Guide.pdf) or the [SteamVR Support pages](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=5254-FJKZ-7829).)
